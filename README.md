**A smartphone audio player that can follow the melody of audio to produce vibration.** It is mainly designed as an Android app compatible to any Android related platform.

I have to say that, I'm still a rookie to this, so surely there are something unclear or wrong in what I described above as well as in the design logic of Viv Beats. **Feel free to let me know!**

_I'll be updating this application unscheduledly ^_^_

> SONY has a similar but more advanced technique that has already been deployed on a few of their own flagship smartphones, by which Viv Beats is partially inspired. Unfortunately, one can never experience that technology unless one has a SONY flagship smartphone, which costs at least about 699 dollars :( The latest model's price even exceeds 1000 dollars, currently in Mainland China.
